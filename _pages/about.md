<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>
I am a 2nd year Ph.D. student at the [National Engineering Research Center of Robot Visual Perception and Control Technology](http://robot.hnu.edu.cn/) of [Hunan University](https://www.hnu.edu.cn/), supervised by [Prof. Wei Sun](https://www.hnu.edu.cn/info/1038/7317.htm). I am currently a Visiting Ph.D. Student at the Machine Intelligence Group of the [University of Western Australia](https://www.uwa.edu.au/), supervised by [Prof. Ajmal Mian](https://ajmalsaeed.net/).

My research focuses on 3D computer vision, deep learning, and their applications for robotic manipulation. Specifically, I have worked on category-level 6D object pose estimation and instance-level 6D object pose tracking. Subsequent research focuses include: label-efficient learning for generalized 6D object pose estimation and tracking. I was motivated to conduct this doctoral research due to my passion for realizing intelligent perception and autonomous manipulation of robots in 3D space.

[**Robotic Continuous Grasping System**](https://github.com/CNJianLiu/6D-CLGrasp) (Demo can be seen through [link1](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV16M4y1Q7CD) or [link2](https://youtu.be/ZeGN6_DChuA))
- We build an end-to-end robotic continuous grasping system, which achieves high-accuracy 6D pose estimation for multiple intra-class unknown objects and high-efficiency robotic grasping in 3D space. For continuous grasping, we propose a low-computation and effective grasping strategy based on the pre-defined vector orientation, and develop a GUI for monitoring and control.
